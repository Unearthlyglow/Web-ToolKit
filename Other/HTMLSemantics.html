Need to create a .index HTML page with all these tags, reads like an actual blog post or some page. Some skeletons using semantics.
</body>

<main>: The <main> HTML element represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or the central functionality of an application. A document mustn't have more than one <main> element that doesn't have the hidden attribute specified.
  
<header>: The <header> element is not sectioning content and therefore does not introduce a new section in the outline. That said a <header> element is intended to usually contain the surrounding section's heading (an h1â€“h6 element) but this is not required.
  
<article>: The article role is used to identify a section of a page that forms an independent part of a document page or site. Examples of an article include web log posts newspaper or magazine articles and user-submitted comments. It is independent in that its contents could stand alone for example in syndication.
  
<section>: think chapters Introduction News Items Contact Info A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction content and contact information.
  
<aside>: The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).
  
<figure>: The <figure> tag specifies self-contained content like illustrations diagrams photos code listings etc.The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element. The <figcaption> element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a <figure> element.
      
  The <img> element defines the actual image/illustration.
