2. Can I nest a pseudo selector within another it's parent selector?

Remainder (%)modulo: 
The remainder operator (%) returns the remainder left over when one operand is divided by a second operand. It always takes the sign of the dividend.

console.log(13 % 5);
// expected output: 3

5 goes into 13 TWICE which = 10, 3 is LEFT OVER. 

15 % 2

You cannot have 3 % 0, this = NaN. You can have 0 % 3 which = 0.
