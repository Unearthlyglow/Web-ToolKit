BREAK 
Compiling SCSS file into CSS file for Vanilla Projects -

        (In the Terminal)
    sass main.scss:main.css --watch

BREAK
Variables -

      $primary-color: rgb(245 231 32);

BREAK
Partials - You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @use rule.

      @use 'nameofPartial'; place this at the top of the file. 


BREAK
Modules - Used to import other scss files.

      @use 'base'; place this at the top of the file.

      .backgroundHeader {
        background-color: base.$primary-color;
        color: white;
      }

BREAK
Mixins - Defines multiple properties in one variable and just as importantly it allows for parameters to be passed through
        
    @mixin theme($theme: rgb(119 198 200)) {
          background: $theme;
          color: blue;
        }

        body {
          @include theme();
        }

BREAK
Extend and Inheritance -

Examples of Inheritance:
This CSS will print because %message-shared is extended. 

    %message-shared {
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
        padding: 10px;
        color: #333;
      }

This CSS won't print because %equal-heights is never extended.

        %another-thing {
          font-size: 30px;
        }

This CSS won't print because %equal-heights is never extended.

        %equal-heights {
          display: flex;
          flex-wrap: wrap;
        }

Examples of Extend:
.message {
  @extend %message-shared;
}

.success {
  @extend %message-shared;
  @extend %another-thing;
  border-color: green;
  
}

BREAK 
Nesting 

.Card {
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 red;

  &__header {
    display: flex;
  }
}
