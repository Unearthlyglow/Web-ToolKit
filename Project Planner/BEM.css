BEM

Class names on all(most) HTML elements.

Block component
.btn {}

Element that depends upon the block 
.btn__price {}

Modifier that changes the style of the block
.btn--orange {} 
.btn--big {}

In this CSS methodology a block is a top-level abstraction of a new component, for example a button: .btn { }. This block should be thought of as a parent. Child items, or elements, can be placed inside and these are denoted by two underscores following the name of the block like .btn__price { }. Finally, modifiers can manipulate the block so that we can theme or style that particular component without inflicting changes on a completely unrelated module. This is done by appending two hyphens to the name of the block just like btn--orange.

The markup might then look like this:

<a class="btn btn--big btn--orange" href="https://css-tricks.com">
  <span class="btn__price">$9.99</span>
  <span class="btn__text">Subscribe</span>
</a>
